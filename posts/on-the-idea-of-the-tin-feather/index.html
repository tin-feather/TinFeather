<p>Tin Feathers has rapidly evolved through multiple stages in the course of the
first serious consideration of the idea, far from the joke with which it began.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>Within the programmer community as elsewhere, there exists individuals and
organizations whose ideas of reality, both scientific and social, are, to put it
tactfully a few standard deviations from the norm. Consider the Flat Earth
Society, an organization whose ideas of planetary physics and geography contrast
strongly with the more widely accepted model of the scientific community. Or
consider those who believe the world to be run by an alien race of lizard people
that live disguised amongst us.</p>
<p>It is common within information technology to jokingly describe such people as
"wearing a tin foil hat." The provenance of this particular label lies in the
claimed ability of such a fashion accessory to protect the wearer from "space
rays used to control the mind." While a Faraday cage is known to protect an
environment from stray electromagnetic radiation and as such, is an important
component of certain scientific experiments, the protection afforded by a "tin
foil hat" is, as you can imagine, a somewhat less established phenomenon.</p>
<p>The original joke of the Tin Feather was as a logo for Tin Feather Industries, a
fictitious company that would sell merchandise to protect buyers from excessive
surveillance and invasion of privacy. Numerous products were imagined that would
be marketed to the paranoid end of a tin-foil-hat-wearing customer base.</p>
<p>Satire can be a powerful means to make statements and focus people's attention.
Upon consideration of the unreasonable extent to which our actions in this world
are tracked and recorded and tallied, both physically and digitally, it was
quickly realized that such a joke could be used to raise awareness of this
social problem. It might actually do some good in the world.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this took place knowing the neologism "surveillance
capitalism" but in ignorance of its author or the seriousness of the issues that
that practice implies. Personal resentment and indignation were enough to
initiate action leading me to put words to paper -- more literally, bytes into
files.</p>
<p>A few thousand words later, though, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> realized that a more important "good"
could be achieved through Tin Feathers than simply a joke with a jag. Raising
awareness of a problem is important. However, successful wide-spread adoption
of the Tin Feather as an icon protesting surveillance capitalism and invasive
data harvesting among the programmer community would be more. It would be a
proof of concept to that same community of a way to come together to effect
social change. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> write of this elsewhere in more detail; let me simply
state here that the software industry has a collection of techniques that could
be valuably applied to the complex problems the world faces today. That same
community, however, shares certain social traits that have, in my opinion,
prevented it from making the full contribution it could.</p>
<p>But programmers know algorithms; they are our bread and butter. We apply them
to solve our problems and we adapt them to attack similar ones. If Tin Feathers
worked as an icon, its greatest benefit might not be raising awareness of one
particular problem, but in serving as a known solution – a proof of concept
– demonstrating how to mobilize the programming community, their skills, and
their talents in tackling the many serious issues the world faces today. This
convinced me that the Tin Feathers programme was worth pursuing.</p>
<p>How then to protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data harvesting?
Proceed using the knowledge and techniques of mathematically informed software
engineering. Detailed analysis is reported elsewhere, but note those first
words: "to protest." Consideration of that alone leads to many points relevant
to protest movements of any nature and human social interaction in general. One
idea in particular struck me as both critically important and widely
unrecognized. A subtle, yet simple mathematical concept which, widely known
would prevent much of the strife seen in today's world and facilitate the common
action needed to address social ills. Surprising myself, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> realized that after
more than half a century on this planet <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> might have something to say to other
people. With a strange mixture of fear, exhilaration, and dread <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> realized
that they might actually benefit by listening.</p>
<p>This is far, far, <em>far</em> beyond my comfort zone as is confessed elsewhere, but
know that it is this that drives me to write and share these words. The
contribution <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> offer is made in the belief that it is unknown to the wider
information technology audience <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> address and that, as a member of that
community <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am in a unique position to deliver it. In doing so <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> draw
courage and inspiration seeing the greater effort to which Eugenia Cheng goes in
trying to teach a broader audience more mathematically sophisticated material.
In <strong>The Art of Logic</strong> she aims to teach that noble subject to people from all
walks of life, to teach us "How to make sense in a world that doesn't." If she
can do this with such style and grace and optimism, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> must at least attempt
to persuade an already logical audience of computer programmers of the wider
relevance of one mathematical concept we already use.</p>
<p>Continued analysis of the Tin Feather programme requires knowledge of the source
of the phrase "surveillance capitalism." While <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> had a notion as to its
meaning, to speak publicly with credibility demands knowledge and familiarity
of its wider use. And so <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am lead to the second work motivating this
action: Shoshana Zuboff's <strong>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</strong>. From the start,
she uncovers and succinctly elucidates what was to me simply a broad sense of
dissatisfaction, defining and thoroughly analyzing surveillance capitalism. She
raises a call to arms, offering her extensive research to inform us of what we
face. Be warned; it is a problem more serious than <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> suspected.</p>
<p>What excites me the most, however, are the nascent ideas emerging as <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> read
both these works: vulnerabilities and weak points of surveillance capitalism, as
well as the logic that will convince my peers to accept the challenge of taking
up arms. From Zuboff <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am alerted to a chink in the armor, a scale missing
from the dragon's underbelly, and from Cheng <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> garner the logical precision to
hit so small a target. Informed and inspired by these two works, the Tin Feather
evolves: from joke, to icon, and, with help and with hope, onward to solution.
Fletched with Tin Feathers our loosed arrows will soon speed towards their
target.</p>
