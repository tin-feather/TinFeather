<p>We (programmers, geeks, techies … call us what you will) may be slow to
anger, slow to indignation. We take a long time to make up our minds. But you

    <div>
<p>As an IT professional <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> feel obliged to clear up a matter oft overlooked in
today's media, both within our community and beyond. That is the matter of data
security. While sceptical of absolutes <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> have studied enough mathematics to
recognize such a rarity when one appears:</p>
<p><strong>There is no such thing as secure data.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps that can be re-worded to be more easily remembered:</p>
<div class="section" id="there-is-no-such-thing-as-secure-data">
<h2><strong>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS SECURE DATA!!!</strong></h2>
<p>Every day it seems there are reports of newer and larger data breaches. Customer
data, government data, health data. On and on without end. One would think that
by now people would realize that there simply is no way to secure data.</p>
<p>"Secure data" is an oxymoron. You have a birthday, as does every person on the
planet. That is a <em>fact</em>. You know it. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do not. Now record that fact and it
becomes <em>data</em>. The defining characteristic of <em>data</em> is that it can be recalled.
Write it on a piece of paper and someone can read it. Record it and someone can
play it back.</p>
<p>If a fact can not be recovered it is not <em>data</em>. Relational database management
systems exist to facilitate data recall. SQL searches, indexing, back-up and
redundancy. These all exist to let people recover stored facts, to manage <em>data</em>.</p>
<p>Within information technology we discuss and debate techniques aimed at securing
database systems. Reading such works, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> can not help thinking of medieval
architects designing ever larger and elaborate keeps, castles, and walled towns.
Despite all their technological advances, it is well known that when such
fortifications fell, it was most often not by force but through human action,
accidental or treasonous. All modern database systems incorporate
the same vulnerability. They are designed to allow the data to be recalled and
read and processed.</p>
<p>And once recalled? That data can leak. Why do we act so surprised?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</strong>"</p>
<p class="attribution">—Isaac Newton, 1675</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This well known quotation expresses an idea that lies at the foundations of the
scientific tradition, mathematics, and open source software, three of the top
intellectual achievements of the human species. Yet in literature it goes unused.
The scientist, mathematician, and programmer readily appropriate and re-purpose
ideas from our predecessors while most authors seem to aim for an entirely
personal creative work.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> am not an author and this is nothing so formal as a "work of
literature." Yet <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> do have ideas to share and know communication requires
shared semantics. These may be found in a set of mathematical axioms, a computer
programming language, but also in a popular movie, in song lyrics, and within
comedy. In the name of pragmatism and due to the urgency of the task at hand <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span>
will make free use of all these sources, the profound to the profane, confident
of their effect, with respect, and in hopeful anticipation of their originators'
approval.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>I am Jack's betrayed sense of privacy.</strong>"</p>

</dl>
<p>Yet precisely because I am no one I presume to speak to everyone.</p>
<p>Birth is trauma. Kicking and fighting we are brought into this world regardless
of our wishes. So it is with a social conscience. I did not want one. I do not
know what to do with it; how to nurture it. Life was decidedly easier before,
but such has fallen to me and I would be remiss not to give it voice. So the
Zeitgeist speaks.</p>
<p>The tin foil hat is a known symbol in our collective semiology. It captures the
suspicion, mistrust, and paranoia all in technology share regarding that with
which we forge our living. We know these tools all too well; we are their smiths.</p>
<p>Money, power, influence. Fake news, election tampering. Fortunes made and
fortunes lost. The rest of the world is slowly awakening to what we have long
been aware of, but hiding from. What we tried to laugh off with a tin hat joke.</p>
<p>I do not know how to fix this world. I know only that the first step is to
acknowledge the problem. That said, we need a forum for discussion, a common
store of information and raw data. We are problem solvers, after all. Can our
"many eyes" and the "wisdom of crowds" solve these problems? We shall see.</p>
<p>And so the Tin Feather. I wear the first in my hat to admit the problem and to
foster conversation. <strong>To protest surveillance capitalism and invasive data
harvesting.</strong> I lay before you not a gauntlet, but merely a feather. Now take it
up.</p>
<p>The tin feather… when a tin hat is too heavy.</p>
