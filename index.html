<p>"Coronavirus: UK considers virus-tracing app to ease lockdown"</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>"My favourite restaurant might ask me to show that I was low-risk before allowing me into a crowded place, and I think that would be a perfectly reasonable price to pay for this step towards returning to normal life," Prof Michael Parker told the BBC.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>"And while he said that the general public should not be compelled to use the app to begin with, he did not rule this out if the majority failed to do so."</p>
<p>"The key question is - does it require everyone to do it for it to be effective?" Prof Parker explained.</p>

<p>Many years ago <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> saw a demonstration of software for navigating super tankers.
The graphical display showed a nautical chart updating in real time centered on
the ship's current location. Extending from the front of the ship's icon  was a
long red line representing the vessel's stopping distance. The end of this line
showed where the ship would be roughly 20 minutes in the future, the amount of
time it would take to stop. If this line touched shore alarms went off. Loud
ones.</p>
<p>Rightly so. Without corrective action, the ship would run aground. T minus 20
minutes until oil spill and natural disaster.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> tell this story to defend accusations of paranoia. Think of the views
expressed here as that red line. Tin Feathers provides a warning of what could
happen given the current direction technology and society are heading. Consider
mine a voice raised in concern. Will we see the worst or will corrective action
be taken? We all better pay attention.</p>

<h2>Identity Management Services</h2>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://libra.org/en-US/">Libra</a> was pretty scary for a while, at least until it became clear that Facebook
was not going to be able to pull it off. A phrase <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> recently ran across
reminded me of something <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> saw in the Libra aftermath, though. <em>Identity
Management Service</em>. Libra wasn't trying to take control of all our money, they
said. They were just looking to establish themselves as an identity management
service.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they failed. I suspect a lot of the blame lies with Zuckerberg
himself given the degree of control he maintains over the company. <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> can
imagine him thinking that he has control of a great portion of the world's
population, pondering how to get control of the rest. "Money. Everyone spends
money. If I control their money I can control them." Perhaps unfair, but it's
my imagination.</p>
<p>What he failed to realize, though, is that people <em>care</em> about their money. And
other people care about other peoples' money. In short, financial industries
are highly, highly regulated.</p>
<p>Now consider <a class="reference external" href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a>. They also offer identity management services. For all your
clients and all your employees. For all an <em>enterprise's</em> clients and employees.
This is Enterprise Software!</p>
<p>What difference does that make? Think about it … enterprise software. We all
know too much about enterprise software. Nobody cares about it. Nobody gives
much of a damn about the software the enterprise uses. Enterprise software is
not regulated.</p>
<p>But it entraps everybody. Every single one of us. Like a tar pit. Any one who
has a job. Any one who has ever had to fill out a human resources form. Every
one who receives a paycheck.</p>
<p>Okta doesn't control us when we go to spend our money; they control us before we
even earn it.</p>
<p>Libra : 0. Okta : 1.</p>
<p>Game over, folks.</p>

<p>Yet another <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02514-7">article</a> warning about the abuse of facial-recognition technology.
And from a respected academic.</p>
<p>Yes, this a nice idea. And yes, <span class="math">\(\iota\)</span> suppose it is necessary to encode regulations
in law. But will the academics and law-makers ever realize that all their laws
and regulations will not stop the problem? Do they not realize that
government security agencies will ignore the law? Are they so naive as to assume
